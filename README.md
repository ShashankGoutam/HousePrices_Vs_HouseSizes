# HousePrices_Vs_HouseSizes
This project uses Python and Linear Regression to predict home prices based on features like size, location, and bedrooms. It covers data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and predictions, showcasing how machine learning aids in understanding real estate pricing trends.

# Predict Home Prices with Python and Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the application of **Linear Regression** to predict home prices based on various features such as the number of rooms, location, and more. It highlights the process of building a machine learning model using Python to analyze real estate data and generate price predictions.

## Project Overview
Housing prices are influenced by various factors, and understanding these factors can be critical for real estate professionals, homeowners, and buyers. This project aims to:
- Develop a predictive model using Linear Regression.
- Provide insights into key factors affecting housing prices.
- Evaluate the model's accuracy with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.
- Building and training a Linear Regression model.
- Evaluating model performance.
- Making predictions on unseen data.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation.
  - `numpy` for numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for building and evaluating the model.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   ggh repo clone ShashankGoutam/HousePrices_Vs_HouseSizes
   cd predict-home-prices
2. Install the required dependencies:
   
  pip install pandas 
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## Data Description
The dataset includes features such as:

Square Footage: Total area of the house.
Number of Bedrooms: Count of bedrooms in the house.
Location: Categorical variable indicating the neighborhood.
Price: Target variable representing the house price.
Note: The dataset used is either public or simulated for learning purposes.

## Model Performance
The Linear Regression model was evaluated using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
R-squared: Indicates how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.

## Results
The model successfully predicted housing prices with reasonable accuracy, providing a strong foundation for understanding price dynamics.
